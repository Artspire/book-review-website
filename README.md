# Project 1

<b>Web Programming with Python and JavaScript</b>

For project1, I have made a book review website called Papyrus.

## Layout

I have made use of Bootstrap for the layout and design of the website, including containers and a navbar. Furthermore, I used a color palette that I found on <a href="https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/9055">color-hex</a>.

## Files

My project folder includes a <i>static</i> folder containing a number images, an icon and a `styles.css` file. The <i>templates</i> folder contains 11 .html template files that make up the website. Furthermore, the project folder contains a `requirements.txt` file listing all the Python packages used, an `import.py` file that was used to import the books in `books.csv` into the database, a `helpers.py` file that defines the @login-required function and, lastly, `application.py` that contains all the necessary Flask code for running the website.

## Functionality

If a user registers

Under 'account settings', a user has the ability to change his password or delete his account.

If a user deletes his account, his book reviews will also be deleted from the database.
